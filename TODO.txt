Each team member has to read the source file (Code.cpp).

Any completed tasks should be marked as completed instead of removing
    them from the list, for example:

    * Critical Bugs
        fixed: - some bug



* System("cls")
    - might cause issues when debugging, should research into it.
        for now, if any issues with printing arise, try removing it.

* Input
    - most string inputs ignore first character.
    - written in C style, should be rewritten to C++ style.

* Output
    - on multiple occasions doesn't drop to a new line before asking for input.
    - some grammatical mistakes found.

* Refactoring
WIP:    - split main file into sub files for classes and implementation.
    - main function has many nested 'switch's and 'if's,
        if possible should extract into functions.

* Critical Bugs
    - class: PersonalDetails
        field: PassportNum
            array has only 9 cells, thus can cause OutOfBounds exception.
        
        method: p_input
            has no input check for max bound, because of static memory
            allocation the hardcoded max bound is 20 items in arrays.
